[**rawfeed**](https://github.com/rawfeed) is a [GitHub](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"} organization created by [William Canin]({{ page.author.url }}){:target="_blank"} dedicated to creating **open-source themes and templates** for static
site generators like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com){:target="_blank"} ( in the future [Astro](https://astro.build){:target="_blank"},
and [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev){:target="_blank"}).

Our focus is to deliver **minimalist designs**, **performance**, and **authentic experiences—no**
clutter, no distractions.

Each theme is developed with modern front-end and SEO best practices, seeking a balance between
aesthetics and performance.

- **Easy installation**, with just one command.
- **Minimalist**, focused on content.
- **Fast**, optimized for performance.
- **Easy to integrate**, with clean and well-documented code.
- **Open-source**, to inspire and evolve with the community.

## Philosophy

> "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." — *Leonardo da Vinci*

We believe that design and code should be simple enough to disappear—and let the content shine.
