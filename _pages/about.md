[**rawfeed**](https://github.com/rawfeed) is an organization in [GitHub](https://github.com/) dedicated to creating **open-source themes and templates** for static
site generators like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) ( in the future [Astro](https://astro.build),
and [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev)).

Our focus is to deliver **minimalist designs**, **performance**, and **authentic experiences—no**
clutter, no distractions.

Each theme is developed with modern front-end and SEO best practices, seeking a balance between
aesthetics and performance.

- **Easy installation**, with just one command.
- **Minimalist**, focused on content.
- **Fast**, optimized for performance.
- **Easy to integrate**, with clean and well-documented code.
- **Open-source**, to inspire and evolve with the community.

## Philosophy

> "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." — *Leonardo da Vinci*

We believe that design and code should be simple enough to disappear—and let the content shine.

## Contribute

Contributions are welcome!
If you want to suggest improvements, report bugs, or submit new themes, please open an **issue** or
**pull request** on the project.
