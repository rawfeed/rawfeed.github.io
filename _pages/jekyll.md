# Installation

In the terminal/Command Prompt, run the commands below according to the OS.

**Unix:**

```shell
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/williamcanin/rawfeed/refs/heads/main/tools/installer/unix/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows:**

```shell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/williamcanin/rawfeed/refs/heads/main/tools/installer/win/install.ps1 | iex
```

# Usage

After installation, run the command below to see the **rawfeed** command menu:

```shell
npm run help
```

# Settings

## Avatar

**(1)** - Create the folder directory: `assets/images`.

**(2)** - Place your website's images (.jpg|.png) inside this `assets/images` directory.

> Recommendation: Use a 4x4 image.

**(3)** - In the `_config.yml` file, in the `section: [avatar]`, change the value of "`avatar.image`"
to the name of your images. For example:

```yml
avatar:
  open: true
  flip: true
  # note: the image (.jpg|.png) will be searched in the directory: assets/images/
  image:
    front:
      light: your_image_light.png
      dark: your_image_dark.png
    back: your_image_back.png
```

## Posts

Creating a blog post is very easy, first you create a draft (`npm run draft`) and after you finish
the draft, you move it to the post with the command `npm run posts`.

> Note: If you start the server (`npm run serve`), drafts will appear in posts, but they will not
go into production mode (`npm run build`).

**Comments:**

Post comments use [Giscus](https://giscus.app) or [Disqus](https://disqus.com),
configurable in the `_config.yml` file under `section: [blog]`. Whichever one you choose,
you must set the appropriate settings in the `_config.yml` file under `section: [blog]`, and
each post must have `comments: true` set.

To learn more about both, such as how to set them up, visit [Giscus](https://giscus.app) or
[Disqus](https://disqus.com).
